Three Interesting Facts I Learned In the Last Three Days:

1. That in a linked list, there is a head pointer that points to the first node.

2. That you can create a circular linked list where the last node points to the first node.

3. You can create linked lists that have each node point not only to their successor, but to their predecessor as well.
